                    <p>This app was created as a student project for my CareerFoundry course. I independently navigated the UX and UI design processes, with some helpful guidance and feedback from my tutor, Thuraya Amin.</p>
                    <h3>Brief</h3>
                    <p>The student brief required that this app satisfy a few requirements:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>create an online retail store app that allows users to quickly and easily find products that meet their needs</li>
                        <li>offer an easy-to-use, clean navigational system with filters that permit users to quickly and effeciently narrow down their product search</li>
                        <li>this tool is particularly valuable to those who struggle to find what they need in physical stores</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>My Process</h2>

                    <h3>Research</h3>
                    <p>As a lady who is always keen on feeling more lady-like, I had recently discovered a surprising method to do just that: weightlifting. After browsing the "before and after" pictures of about a million ladies that my Google search for "female body transformations from weightlifting" procured, my initial shock wore off and I began to plan how I might go about hitting the weights to build my own curves. I quickly discovered that my local options were mostly male Physical Trainers who, though qualified, didn't offer the type of tailored program I was seeking. I hopped online and found some programs geared towards building the booty, but they turned out to be very one-size-fits-all, and many required a monthly fee, and left a lot of room for guessing. I realized there was a gap. What I wanted was options that were cheaper, and offered more variety and educational content. I joined a facebook group for women who lift and soon realized my desire for more support on how to build curves was shared.</p>

                    <p><i>Note: there is definitely a larger availability of coaches for advanced bodybuilding women training to compete, but this focus is on your average woman hoping to feel more confident in her body, and not seeking to gain a super cut and muscular physique.</i></p>

                    <h3>Define the Problem</h3>
                    <p>This recent personal experience provided me with an excellent topic for my student project. I was excited to create a solution to the problem, and began by defining it:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>a lack of accessible Physical Trainers spefically for women with the goal of building a feminine physique (lower-body focused)</li>
                        <li>a scarcity of affordable (one-time payment) curve-enhancing, weight-training programs tailored to everyday women</li>
                        <li></li>
                    </ul>
