        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>This was a project from the CareerFoundry curriculum. The purpose was to showcase my UX/UI
          Design abilities through the development of my HTML, CSS and Javascript skills by building a
          website from scratch to host my portfolio.</p>

        <h2>Context and Challenge</h2>

        <h3>Background and Description</h3>
        <p>This project was a part of my Frontend Web Development for
          Designers course through CareerFoundry. Using HTML, CSS, and JS, my aim was to write the code
          for my design portfolio website.</p>

        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>As an aspiring designer, I lacked a way to showcase my work to prospective employers
          or clients.</p>

        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <p>Build a professional network through an online presence and provide future work
          opportunities with the means to see my work and contact me for jobs via my design portfolio
          website.</p>

        <h2>Process and Insights</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Selected a feel to later apply to my website using typography, colors, and content</li>
          <br>
          <li>Input HTML, CSS and JS code into Atom files to produce a mobile-first, responsive design based
            upon a provided low-fidelity wireframe</li>
          <br>
          <li>Constantly checked my results for each break point in the browser in order to catch problems
            early on</li>
          <br>
          <li>Shared my progress with my mentor for feedback via GitHub and revised accordingly</li>
          <br>
          <li>Inserted my personal information and my case studies showcasing my design projects once the
            structure of the website was intact</li>
          <br>
          <li>Modified the website design to fit my personal style and preferences once I felt comfortable with
            my coding capabilities</li>
          <br>
          <li>Conducted user testing with 5 participants</li>
          <br>
          <li>Using my discretion, I revised my websiteâ€™s design and content based upon user feedback</li>
          <br>
          <li>Cross-browser tested my final design and made any necessary tweaks to the website before
            publishing it</li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        <p>I initially selected to stick to the provided design template as I was learning to code. Once the basic
          website structure was good to go and my content inserted appropriately, I took more creative
          liberty and adapted the layout to better fit my style. My goal was to design a website that was
          subtle enough to let my projects shine, but not so dull as to be boring or bland. This was the fun
          part, as I felt confident enough to edit the code without instructions and create something more
          original. My mentor was extremely helpful along the way, knowing when to guide me and when to
          let me scramble for the solution on my own. When I did scramble, I learned a lot about how to be
          resourceful when it comes to learning code, and discovered many insightful articles and youtube
          channels along the way.</p>
